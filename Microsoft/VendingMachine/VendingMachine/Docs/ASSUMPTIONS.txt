Here are a few assumptions that were made for this project:

1) When a user presses a key that is not listed in the instructions, the instructions are printed again.
2) The instructions are not reprinted after a selection is made.
3) Selecting an item from the vending machine and inserting money are 2 steps (ie to select the option, then to enter a choice/amount)
4) If during the item selection or during inserting money, the user enters invalid data, the vending machine returns to the top level, 
   ie, waiting for the user to select one of the options listed in the instructions (without reprinting instructions).
5) The program will read a key input without echo for instruction actions, but requires the user to press enter after entering an amount or selecting an item.
6) The program was not designed to handle any kind of tampering, for example, modifying or removing the VendingMachineDB.xml file before or during execution.
7) The messages for the user are all hardcoded, but normally in a full application these strings would be placed in resource files.
8) This program was built with Visual C# Express 2010, which does not have a built-in testing framework (2013 includes MS Test). Therefore, no automated unit tests were created.
9) If an item is sold out, and there is not enough money in the machine to make a purchase, only the message stating the item is sold out will be printed.
